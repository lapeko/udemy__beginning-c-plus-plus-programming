3        ACT I
4        PROLOGUE
5        Two households, both alike in dignity,
6        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
7        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
8        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
9        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
10       A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
11       Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
12       Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
13       The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
14       And the continuance of their parents' rage,
15       Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
16       Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
17       The which if you with patient ears attend,
18       What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
19       SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
20       Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
21       SAMPSON
22       Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
23       GREGORY
24       No, for then we should be colliers.
25       SAMPSON
26       I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
27       GREGORY
28       Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
29       SAMPSON
30       I strike quickly, being moved.
31       GREGORY
32       But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
33       SAMPSON
34       A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
35       GREGORY
36       To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
37       therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
38       SAMPSON
39       A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
40       take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
41       GREGORY
42       That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
43       to the wall.
44       SAMPSON
45       True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
46       are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
47       Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
48       to the wall.
49       GREGORY
50       The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
51       SAMPSON
52       'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
53       have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
54       maids, and cut off their heads.
55       GREGORY
56       The heads of the maids?
57       SAMPSON
58       Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
59       take it in what sense thou wilt.
60       GREGORY
61       They must take it in sense that feel it.
62       SAMPSON
63       Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
64       'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
65       GREGORY
66       'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
67       hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
68       two of the house of the Montagues.
69       SAMPSON
70       My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
71       GREGORY
72       How! turn thy back and run?
73       SAMPSON
74       Fear me not.
75       GREGORY
76       No, marry; I fear thee!
77       SAMPSON
78       Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
79       GREGORY
80       I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
81       they list.
82       SAMPSON
83       Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
84       which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
85       Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR
86       
87       ABRAHAM
88       Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
89       SAMPSON
90       I do bite my thumb, sir.
91       ABRAHAM
92       Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
93       SAMPSON
94       [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
95       ay?
96       GREGORY
97       No.
98       SAMPSON
99       No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
100      bite my thumb, sir.
101      GREGORY
102      Do you quarrel, sir?
103      ABRAHAM
104      Quarrel sir! no, sir.
105      SAMPSON
106      If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
107      ABRAHAM
108      No better.
109      SAMPSON
110      Well, sir.
111      GREGORY
112      Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
113      SAMPSON
114      Yes, better, sir.
115      ABRAHAM
116      You lie.
117      SAMPSON
118      Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
119      They fight
120      
121      Enter BENVOLIO
122      
123      BENVOLIO
124      Part, fools!
125      Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
126      Beats down their swords
127      
128      Enter TYBALT
129      
130      TYBALT
131      What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
132      Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
133      BENVOLIO
134      I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
135      Or manage it to part these men with me.
136      TYBALT
137      What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
138      As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
139      Have at thee, coward!
140      They fight
141      
142      Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs
143      
144      First Citizen
145      Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
146      Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
147      Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET
148      
149      CAPULET
150      What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
151      LADY CAPULET
152      A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
153      CAPULET
154      My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
155      And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
156      Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
157      
158      MONTAGUE
159      Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
160      LADY MONTAGUE
161      Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
162      Enter PRINCE, with Attendants
163      
164      PRINCE
165      Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
166      Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
167      Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
168      That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
169      With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
170      On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
171      Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
172      And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
173      Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
174      By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
175      Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
176      And made Verona's ancient citizens
177      Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
178      To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
179      Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
180      If ever you disturb our streets again,
181      Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
182      For this time, all the rest depart away:
183      You Capulet; shall go along with me:
184      And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
185      To know our further pleasure in this case,
186      To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
187      Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
188      Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO
189      
190      MONTAGUE
191      Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
192      Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
193      BENVOLIO
194      Here were the servants of your adversary,
195      And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
196      I drew to part them: in the instant came
197      The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
198      Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
199      He swung about his head and cut the winds,
200      Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
201      While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
202      Came more and more and fought on part and part,
203      Till the prince came, who parted either part.
204      LADY MONTAGUE
205      O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
206      Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
207      BENVOLIO
208      Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
209      Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
210      A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
211      Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
212      That westward rooteth from the city's side,
213      So early walking did I see your son:
214      Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
215      And stole into the covert of the wood:
216      I, measuring his affections by my own,
217      That most are busied when they're most alone,
218      Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
219      And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
220      MONTAGUE
221      Many a morning hath he there been seen,
222      With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
223      Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
224      But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
225      Should in the furthest east begin to draw
226      The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
227      Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
228      And private in his chamber pens himself,
229      Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
230      And makes himself an artificial night:
231      Black and portentous must this humour prove,
232      Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
233      BENVOLIO
234      My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
235      MONTAGUE
236      I neither know it nor can learn of him.
237      BENVOLIO
238      Have you importuned him by any means?
239      MONTAGUE
240      Both by myself and many other friends:
241      But he, his own affections' counsellor,
242      Is to himself--I will not say how true--
243      But to himself so secret and so close,
244      So far from sounding and discovery,
245      As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
246      Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
247      Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
248      Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
249      We would as willingly give cure as know.
250      Enter ROMEO
251      
252      BENVOLIO
253      See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
254      I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
255      MONTAGUE
256      I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
257      To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
258      Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
259      
260      BENVOLIO
261      Good-morrow, cousin.
262      ROMEO
263      Is the day so young?
264      BENVOLIO
265      But new struck nine.
266      ROMEO
267      Ay me! sad hours seem long.
268      Was that my father that went hence so fast?
269      BENVOLIO
270      It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
271      ROMEO
272      Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
273      BENVOLIO
274      In love?
275      ROMEO
276      Out--
277      BENVOLIO
278      Of love?
279      ROMEO
280      Out of her favour, where I am in love.
281      BENVOLIO
282      Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
283      Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
284      ROMEO
285      Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
286      Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
287      Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
288      Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
289      Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
290      Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
291      O any thing, of nothing first create!
292      O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
293      Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
294      Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
295      sick health!
296      Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
297      This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
298      Dost thou not laugh?
299      BENVOLIO
300      No, coz, I rather weep.
301      ROMEO
302      Good heart, at what?
303      BENVOLIO
304      At thy good heart's oppression.
305      ROMEO
306      Why, such is love's transgression.
307      Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
308      Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
309      With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
310      Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
311      Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
312      Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
313      Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
314      What is it else? a madness most discreet,
315      A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
316      Farewell, my coz.
317      BENVOLIO
318      Soft! I will go along;
319      An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
320      ROMEO
321      Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
322      This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
323      BENVOLIO
324      Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
325      ROMEO
326      What, shall I groan and tell thee?
327      BENVOLIO
328      Groan! why, no.
329      But sadly tell me who.
330      ROMEO
331      Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
332      Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
333      In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
334      BENVOLIO
335      I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
336      ROMEO
337      A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
338      BENVOLIO
339      A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
340      ROMEO
341      Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
342      With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
343      And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
344      From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
345      She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
346      Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
347      Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
348      O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
349      That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
350      BENVOLIO
351      Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
352      ROMEO
353      She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
354      For beauty starved with her severity
355      Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
356      She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
357      To merit bliss by making me despair:
358      She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
359      Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
360      BENVOLIO
361      Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
362      ROMEO
363      O, teach me how I should forget to think.
364      BENVOLIO
365      By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
366      Examine other beauties.
367      ROMEO
368      'Tis the way
369      To call hers exquisite, in question more:
370      These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
371      Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
372      He that is strucken blind cannot forget
373      The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
374      Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
375      What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
376      Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
377      Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
378      BENVOLIO
379      I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
380      Exeunt
381      
382      SCENE II. A street.
383      Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant
384      CAPULET
385      But Montague is bound as well as I,
386      In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
387      For men so old as we to keep the peace.
388      PARIS
389      Of honourable reckoning are you both;
390      And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
391      But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
392      CAPULET
393      But saying o'er what I have said before:
394      My child is yet a stranger in the world;
395      She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
396      Let two more summers wither in their pride,
397      Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
398      PARIS
399      Younger than she are happy mothers made.
400      CAPULET
401      And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
402      The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
403      She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
404      But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
405      My will to her consent is but a part;
406      An she agree, within her scope of choice
407      Lies my consent and fair according voice.
408      This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
409      Whereto I have invited many a guest,
410      Such as I love; and you, among the store,
411      One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
412      At my poor house look to behold this night
413      Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
414      Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
415      When well-apparell'd April on the heel
416      Of limping winter treads, even such delight
417      Among fresh female buds shall you this night
418      Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
419      And like her most whose merit most shall be:
420      Which on more view, of many mine being one
421      May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
422      Come, go with me.
423      To Servant, giving a paper
424      
425      Go, sirrah, trudge about
426      Through fair Verona; find those persons out
427      Whose names are written there, and to them say,
428      My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
429      Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS
430      
431      Servant
432      Find them out whose names are written here! It is
433      written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
434      yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with

436      sent to find those persons whose names are here
437      writ, and can never find what names the writing
438      person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.

441      BENVOLIO
442      Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
443      One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
444      Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
445      One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
446      Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
447      And the rank poison of the old will die.
448      ROMEO
449      Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
450      BENVOLIO
451      For what, I pray thee?
452      ROMEO
453      For your broken shin.
454      BENVOLIO
455      Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
456      ROMEO
457      Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
458      Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
459      Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
460      Servant
461      God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
462      ROMEO
463      Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
464      Servant
465      Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
466      pray, can you read any thing you see?
467      ROMEO
468      Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
469      Servant
470      Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
471      ROMEO
472      Stay, fellow; I can read.
473      Reads

476      County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
477      widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
478      nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
479      uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
480      Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
481      Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
482      assembly: whither should they come?

484      Up.
485      ROMEO
486      Whither?
487      Servant
488      To supper; to our house.
489      ROMEO
490      Whose house?
491      Servant
492      My master's.
493      ROMEO
494      Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
495      Servant
496      Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
497      great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
498      of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
499      Rest you merry!

503      At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
504      Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
505      With all the admired beauties of Verona:
506      Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
507      Compare her face with some that I shall show,
508      And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
509      ROMEO
510      When the devout religion of mine eye
511      Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
512      And these, who often drown'd could never die,
513      Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
514      One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
515      Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
516      BENVOLIO
517      Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
518      Herself poised with herself in either eye:
519      But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
520      Your lady's love against some other maid
521      That I will show you shining at this feast,
522      And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
523      ROMEO
524      I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
525      But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

528      SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.
529      Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
530      LADY CAPULET
531      Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
532      Nurse
533      Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
534      I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
535      God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
536      Enter JULIET
537      
538      JULIET
539      How now! who calls?
540      Nurse
541      Your mother.
542      JULIET
543      Madam, I am here.
544      What is your will?
545      LADY CAPULET
546      This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
547      We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
548      I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
549      Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
550      Nurse
551      Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
552      LADY CAPULET
553      She's not fourteen.
554      Nurse
555      I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
556      And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
557      She is not fourteen. How long is it now
558      To Lammas-tide?
559      LADY CAPULET
560      A fortnight and odd days.
561      Nurse
562      Even or odd, of all days in the year,
563      Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
564      Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
565      Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
566      She was too good for me: but, as I said,
567      On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
568      That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
569      'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
570      And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
571      Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
572      For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
573      Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
574      My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
575      Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
576      When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
577      Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
578      To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
579      Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
580      To bid me trudge:
581      And since that time it is eleven years;
582      For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
583      She could have run and waddled all about;
584      For even the day before, she broke her brow:
585      And then my husband--God be with his soul!
586      A' was a merry man--took up the child:
587      'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
588      Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
589      Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
590      The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
591      To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
592      I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
593      I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
594      And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
595      LADY CAPULET
596      Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
597      Nurse
598      Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
599      To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
600      And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
601      A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
602      A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
603      'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
604      Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
605      Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
606      JULIET
607      And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
608      Nurse
609      Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
610      Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
611      An I might live to see thee married once,
612      I have my wish.
613      LADY CAPULET
614      Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
615      I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
616      How stands your disposition to be married?
617      JULIET
618      It is an honour that I dream not of.
619      Nurse
620      An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
621      I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
622      LADY CAPULET
623      Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
624      Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
625      Are made already mothers: by my count,
626      I was your mother much upon these years
627      That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
628      The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
629      Nurse
630      A man, young lady! lady, such a man
631      As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
632      LADY CAPULET
633      Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
634      Nurse
635      Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
636      LADY CAPULET
637      What say you? can you love the gentleman?
638      This night you shall behold him at our feast;
639      Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
640      And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
641      Examine every married lineament,
642      And see how one another lends content
643      And what obscured in this fair volume lies
644      Find written in the margent of his eyes.
645      This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
646      To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
647      The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
648      For fair without the fair within to hide:
649      That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
650      That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
651      So shall you share all that he doth possess,
652      By having him, making yourself no less.
653      Nurse
654      No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
655      LADY CAPULET
656      Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
657      JULIET
658      I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
659      But no more deep will I endart mine eye
660      Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
661      Enter a Servant
662      
663      Servant
664      Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
665      called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
666      the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
667      hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
668      LADY CAPULET
669      We follow thee.
670      Exit Servant
671      
672      Juliet, the county stays.
673      Nurse
674      Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
675      Exeunt
676      
677      SCENE IV. A street.
678      Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others
679      ROMEO
680      What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
681      Or shall we on without a apology?
682      BENVOLIO
683      The date is out of such prolixity:
684      We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
685      Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
686      Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
687      Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
688      After the prompter, for our entrance:
689      But let them measure us by what they will;
690      We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
691      ROMEO
692      Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
693      Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
694      MERCUTIO
695      Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
696      ROMEO
697      Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
698      With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
699      So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
700      MERCUTIO
701      You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
702      And soar with them above a common bound.
703      ROMEO
704      I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
705      To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
706      I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
707      Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
708      MERCUTIO
709      And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
710      Too great oppression for a tender thing.
711      ROMEO
712      Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
713      Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
714      MERCUTIO
715      If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
716      Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
717      Give me a case to put my visage in:
718      A visor for a visor! what care I
719      What curious eye doth quote deformities?
720      Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
721      BENVOLIO
722      Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
723      But every man betake him to his legs.
724      ROMEO
725      A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
726      Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
727      For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
728      I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
729      The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
730      MERCUTIO
731      Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
732      If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
733      Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
734      Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
735      ROMEO
736      Nay, that's not so.
737      MERCUTIO
738      I mean, sir, in delay
739      We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
740      Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
741      Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
742      ROMEO
743      And we mean well in going to this mask;
744      But 'tis no wit to go.
745      MERCUTIO
746      Why, may one ask?
747      ROMEO
748      I dream'd a dream to-night.
749      MERCUTIO
750      And so did I.
751      ROMEO
752      Well, what was yours?
753      MERCUTIO
754      That dreamers often lie.
755      ROMEO
756      In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
757      MERCUTIO
758      O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
759      She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
760      In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
761      On the fore-finger of an alderman,
762      Drawn with a team of little atomies
763      Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
764      Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
765      The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
766      The traces of the smallest spider's web,
767      The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
768      Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
769      Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
770      Not so big as a round little worm
771      Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
772      Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
773      Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
774      Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
775      And in this state she gallops night by night
776      Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
777      O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
778      O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
779      O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
780      Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
781      Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
782      Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
783      And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
784      And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
785      Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
786      Then dreams, he of another benefice:
787      Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
788      And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
789      Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
790      Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
791      Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
792      And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
793      And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
794      That plats the manes of horses in the night,
795      And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
796      Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
797      This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
798      That presses them and learns them first to bear,
799      Making them women of good carriage:
800      This is she--
801      ROMEO
802      Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
803      Thou talk'st of nothing.
804      MERCUTIO
805      True, I talk of dreams,
806      Which are the children of an idle brain,
807      Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
808      Which is as thin of substance as the air
809      And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
810      Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
811      And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
812      Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
813      BENVOLIO
814      This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
815      Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
816      ROMEO
817      I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
818      Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
819      Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
820      With this night's revels and expire the term
821      Of a despised life closed in my breast
822      By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
823      But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
824      Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
825      BENVOLIO
826      Strike, drum.
827      Exeunt
828      
829      SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.
830      Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins
831      First Servant
832      Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
833      shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
834      Second Servant
835      When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
836      hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
837      First Servant
838      Away with the joint-stools, remove the
839      court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
840      me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
841      the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
842      Antony, and Potpan!
843      Second Servant
844      Ay, boy, ready.
845      First Servant
846      You are looked for and called for, asked for and
847      sought for, in the great chamber.
848      Second Servant
849      We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
850      brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
851      Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers
852      
853      CAPULET
854      Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
855      Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
856      Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
857      Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
858      She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
859      Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
860      That I have worn a visor and could tell
861      A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
862      Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
863      You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
864      A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
865      Music plays, and they dance
866      
867      More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
868      And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
869      Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
870      Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
871      For you and I are past our dancing days:
872      How long is't now since last yourself and I
873      Were in a mask?
874      Second Capulet
875      By'r lady, thirty years.
876      CAPULET
877      What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
878      'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
879      Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
880      Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
881      Second Capulet
882      'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
883      His son is thirty.
884      CAPULET
885      Will you tell me that?
886      His son was but a ward two years ago.
887      ROMEO
888      [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
889      enrich the hand
890      Of yonder knight?
891      Servant
892      I know not, sir.
893      ROMEO
894      O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
895      It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
896      Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
897      Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
898      So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
899      As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
900      The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
901      And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
902      Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
903      For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
904      TYBALT
905      This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
906      Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
907      Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
908      To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
909      Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
910      To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
911      CAPULET
912      Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
913      TYBALT
914      Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
915      A villain that is hither come in spite,
916      To scorn at our solemnity this night.
917      CAPULET
918      Young Romeo is it?
919      TYBALT
920      'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
921      CAPULET
922      Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
923      He bears him like a portly gentleman;
924      And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
925      To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
926      I would not for the wealth of all the town
927      Here in my house do him disparagement:
928      Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
929      It is my will, the which if thou respect,
930      Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
931      And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
932      TYBALT
933      It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
934      I'll not endure him.
935      CAPULET
936      He shall be endured:
937      What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
938      Am I the master here, or you? go to.
939      You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
940      You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
941      You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
942      TYBALT
943      Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
944      CAPULET
945      Go to, go to;
946      You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
947      This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
948      You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
949      Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
950      Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
951      I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
952      TYBALT
953      Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
954      Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
955      I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
956      Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

959      ROMEO
960      [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
961      This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
962      My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
963      To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
964      JULIET
965      Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
966      Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
967      For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
968      And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
969      ROMEO
970      Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
971      JULIET
972      Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
973      ROMEO
974      O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
975      They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
976      JULIET
977      Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
978      ROMEO
979      Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
980      Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
981      JULIET
982      Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
983      ROMEO
984      Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
985      Give me my sin again.
986      JULIET
987      You kiss by the book.
988      Nurse
989      Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
990      ROMEO
991      What is her mother?
992      Nurse
993      Marry, bachelor,
994      Her mother is the lady of the house,
995      And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
996      I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
997      I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
998      Shall have the chinks.
999      ROMEO
1000     Is she a Capulet?
1001     O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
1002     BENVOLIO
1003     Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
1004     ROMEO
1005     Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
1006     CAPULET
1007     Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
1008     We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
1009     Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
1010     I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
1011     More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
1012     Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
1013     I'll to my rest.
1014     Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse
1015     
1016     JULIET
1017     Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
1018     Nurse
1019     The son and heir of old Tiberio.
1020     JULIET
1021     What's he that now is going out of door?
1022     Nurse
1023     Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
1024     JULIET
1025     What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
1026     Nurse
1027     I know not.
1028     JULIET
1029     Go ask his name: if he be married.
1030     My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
1031     Nurse
1032     His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
1033     The only son of your great enemy.
1034     JULIET
1035     My only love sprung from my only hate!
1036     Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
1037     Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
1038     That I must love a loathed enemy.
1039     Nurse
1040     What's this? what's this?
1041     JULIET
1042     A rhyme I learn'd even now
1043     Of one I danced withal.
1044     One calls within 'Juliet.'
1045     
1046     Nurse
1047     Anon, anon!
1048     Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

1051     ACT II
1052     PROLOGUE
1053     Enter Chorus
1054     Chorus
1055     Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
1056     And young affection gapes to be his heir;
1057     That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
1058     With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
1059     Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
1060     Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
1061     But to his foe supposed he must complain,
1062     And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
1063     Being held a foe, he may not have access
1064     To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
1065     And she as much in love, her means much less
1066     To meet her new-beloved any where:
1067     But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
1068     Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
1069     Exit
1070     
1071     SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
1072     Enter ROMEO
1073     ROMEO
1074     Can I go forward when my heart is here?
1075     Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
1076     He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it
1077     
1078     Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
1079     
1080     BENVOLIO
1081     Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
1082     MERCUTIO
1083     He is wise;
1084     And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
1085     BENVOLIO
1086     He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
1087     Call, good Mercutio.
1088     MERCUTIO
1089     Nay, I'll conjure too.
1090     Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
1091     Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
1092     Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
1093     Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
1094     Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
1095     One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
1096     Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
1097     When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
1098     He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
1099     The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
1100     I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
1101     By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
1102     By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
1103     And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
1104     That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
1105     BENVOLIO
1106     And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
1107     MERCUTIO
1108     This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
1109     To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
1110     Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
1111     Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
1112     That were some spite: my invocation
1113     Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
1114     I conjure only but to raise up him.
1115     BENVOLIO
1116     Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
1117     To be consorted with the humorous night:
1118     Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
1119     MERCUTIO
1120     If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
1121     Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
1122     And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
1123     As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
1124     Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
1125     An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
1126     Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
1127     This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
1128     Come, shall we go?
1129     BENVOLIO
1130     Go, then; for 'tis in vain
1131     To seek him here that means not to be found.
1132     Exeunt
1133     
1134     SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
1135     Enter ROMEO
1136     ROMEO
1137     He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
1138     JULIET appears above at a window
1139     
1140     But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
1141     It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
1142     Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
1143     Who is already sick and pale with grief,
1144     That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
1145     Be not her maid, since she is envious;
1146     Her vestal livery is but sick and green
1147     And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
1148     It is my lady, O, it is my love!
1149     O, that she knew she were!
1150     She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
1151     Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
1152     I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
1153     Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
1154     Having some business, do entreat her eyes
1155     To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
1156     What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
1157     The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
1158     As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
1159     Would through the airy region stream so bright
1160     That birds would sing and think it were not night.
1161     See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
1162     O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
1163     That I might touch that cheek!
1164     JULIET
1165     Ay me!
1166     ROMEO
1167     She speaks:
1168     O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
1169     As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
1170     As is a winged messenger of heaven
1171     Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
1172     Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
1173     When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
1174     And sails upon the bosom of the air.
1175     JULIET
1176     O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
1177     Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
1178     Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
1179     And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
1180     ROMEO
1181     [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
1182     JULIET
1183     'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
1184     Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
1185     What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
1186     Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
1187     Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
1188     What's in a name? that which we call a rose
1189     By any other name would smell as sweet;
1190     So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
1191     Retain that dear perfection which he owes
1192     Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
1193     And for that name which is no part of thee
1194     Take all myself.
1195     ROMEO
1196     I take thee at thy word:
1197     Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
1198     Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
1199     JULIET
1200     What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
1201     So stumblest on my counsel?
1202     ROMEO
1203     By a name
1204     I know not how to tell thee who I am:
1205     My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
1206     Because it is an enemy to thee;
1207     Had I it written, I would tear the word.
1208     JULIET
1209     My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
1210     Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
1211     Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
1212     ROMEO
1213     Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
1214     JULIET
1215     How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
1216     The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
1217     And the place death, considering who thou art,
1218     If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
1219     ROMEO
1220     With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
1221     For stony limits cannot hold love out,
1222     And what love can do that dares love attempt;
1223     Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
1224     JULIET
1225     If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
1226     ROMEO
1227     Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
1228     Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
1229     And I am proof against their enmity.
1230     JULIET
1231     I would not for the world they saw thee here.
1232     ROMEO
1233     I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
1234     And but thou love me, let them find me here:
1235     My life were better ended by their hate,
1236     Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
1237     JULIET
1238     By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
1239     ROMEO
1240     By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
1241     He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
1242     I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
1243     As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
1244     I would adventure for such merchandise.
1245     JULIET
1246     Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
1247     Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
1248     For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
1249     Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
1250     What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
1251     Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
1252     And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
1253     Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
1254     Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
1255     If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
1256     Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
1257     I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
1258     So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
1259     In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
1260     And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
1261     But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
1262     Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
1263     I should have been more strange, I must confess,
1264     But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
1265     My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
1266     And not impute this yielding to light love,
1267     Which the dark night hath so discovered.
1268     ROMEO
1269     Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
1270     That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
1271     JULIET
1272     O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
1273     That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1274     Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
1275     ROMEO
1276     What shall I swear by?
1277     JULIET
1278     Do not swear at all;
1279     Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1280     Which is the god of my idolatry,
1281     And I'll believe thee.
1282     ROMEO
1283     If my heart's dear love--
1284     JULIET
1285     Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
1286     I have no joy of this contract to-night:
1287     It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
1288     Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1289     Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
1290     This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1291     May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1292     Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
1293     Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
1294     ROMEO
1295     O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
1296     JULIET
1297     What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
1298     ROMEO
1299     The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
1300     JULIET
1301     I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
1302     And yet I would it were to give again.
1303     ROMEO
1304     Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
1305     JULIET
1306     But to be frank, and give it thee again.
1307     And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
1308     My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1309     My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
1310     The more I have, for both are infinite.
1311     Nurse calls within
1312     
1313     I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
1314     Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
1315     Stay but a little, I will come again.

1319     O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.

1325     Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1326     If that thy bent of love be honourable,
1327     Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
1328     By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1329     Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
1330     And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1331     And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
1332     Nurse
1333     [Within] Madam!
1334     JULIET
1335     I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
1336     I do beseech thee--
1337     Nurse
1338     [Within] Madam!
1339     JULIET
1340     By and by, I come:--
1341     To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
1342     To-morrow will I send.
1343     ROMEO
1344     So thrive my soul--

1346     A thousand times good night!

1350     A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.

1359     Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
1360     To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
1361     Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
1362     Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
1363     And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
1364     With repetition of my Romeo's name.
1365     ROMEO
1366     It is my soul that calls upon my name:
1367     How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1368     Like softest music to attending ears!

1372     My dear?

1374     At what o'clock to-morrow
1375     Shall I send to thee?
1376     ROMEO
1377     At the hour of nine.
1378     JULIET
1379     I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
1380     I have forgot why I did call thee back.
1381     ROMEO
1382     Let me stand here till thou remember it.
1383     JULIET
1384     I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1385     Remembering how I love thy company.
1386     ROMEO
1387     And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1388     Forgetting any other home but this.

1390     'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
1391     And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
1392     Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
1393     Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
1394     And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
1395     So loving-jealous of his liberty.
1396     ROMEO
1397     I would I were thy bird.
1398     JULIET
1399     Sweet, so would I:
1400     Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
1401     Good night, good night! parting is such
1402     sweet sorrow,
1403     That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

1410     His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
1411     Exit

1413     SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
1414     Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket
1415     FRIAR LAURENCE
1416     The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
1417     Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
1418     And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
1419     From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
1420     Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
1421     The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
1422     I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
1423     With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
1424     The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
1425     What is her burying grave that is her womb,
1426     And from her womb children of divers kind
1427     We sucking on her natural bosom find,
1428     Many for many virtues excellent,
1429     None but for some and yet all different.
1430     O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
1431     In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
1432     For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
1433     But to the earth some special good doth give,
1434     Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
1435     Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
1436     Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
1437     And vice sometimes by action dignified.
1438     Within the infant rind of this small flower
1439     Poison hath residence and medicine power:
1440     For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
1441     Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
1442     Two such opposed kings encamp them still
1443     In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
1444     And where the worser is predominant,
1445     Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
1446     Enter ROMEO
1447     
1448     ROMEO
1449     Good morrow, father.
1450     FRIAR LAURENCE
1451     Benedicite!
1452     What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
1453     Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
1454     So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
1455     Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
1456     And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
1457     But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
1458     Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
1459     Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
1460     Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
1461     Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
1462     Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
1463     ROMEO
1464     That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
1465     FRIAR LAURENCE
1466     God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
1467     ROMEO
1468     With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
1469     I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
1470     FRIAR LAURENCE
1471     That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
1472     ROMEO
1473     I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
1474     I have been feasting with mine enemy,
1475     Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
1476     That's by me wounded: both our remedies
1477     Within thy help and holy physic lies:
1478     I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
1479     My intercession likewise steads my foe.
1480     FRIAR LAURENCE
1481     Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
1482     Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
1483     ROMEO
1484     Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
1485     On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
1486     As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
1487     And all combined, save what thou must combine
1488     By holy marriage: when and where and how
1489     We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
1490     I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
1491     That thou consent to marry us to-day.
1492     FRIAR LAURENCE
1493     Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
1494     Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
1495     So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
1496     Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1497     Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
1498     Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
1499     How much salt water thrown away in waste,
1500     To season love, that of it doth not taste!
1501     The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
1502     Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
1503     Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
1504     Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
1505     If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
1506     Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
1507     And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
1508     Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
1509     ROMEO
1510     Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
1511     FRIAR LAURENCE
1512     For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
1513     ROMEO
1514     And bad'st me bury love.
1515     FRIAR LAURENCE
1516     Not in a grave,
1517     To lay one in, another out to have.
1518     ROMEO
1519     I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
1520     Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
1521     The other did not so.
1522     FRIAR LAURENCE
1523     O, she knew well
1524     Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
1525     But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
1526     In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
1527     For this alliance may so happy prove,
1528     To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
1529     ROMEO
1530     O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
1531     FRIAR LAURENCE
1532     Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
1533     Exeunt
1534     
1535     SCENE IV. A street.
1536     Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
1537     MERCUTIO
1538     Where the devil should this Romeo be?
1539     Came he not home to-night?
1540     BENVOLIO
1541     Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
1542     MERCUTIO
1543     Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
1544     Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
1545     BENVOLIO
1546     Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
1547     Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
1548     MERCUTIO
1549     A challenge, on my life.
1550     BENVOLIO
1551     Romeo will answer it.
1552     MERCUTIO
1553     Any man that can write may answer a letter.
1554     BENVOLIO
1555     Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
1556     dares, being dared.
1557     MERCUTIO
1558     Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
1559     white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
1560     love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
1561     blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
1562     encounter Tybalt?
1563     BENVOLIO
1564     Why, what is Tybalt?
1565     MERCUTIO
1566     More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
1567     the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
1568     you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
1569     proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
1570     the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
1571     button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
1572     very first house, of the first and second cause:
1573     ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
1574     hai!
1575     BENVOLIO
1576     The what?
1577     MERCUTIO
1578     The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
1579     fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
1580     a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
1581     whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
1582     grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
1583     these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
1584     perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
1585     that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
1586     bones, their bones!
1587     Enter ROMEO
1588     
1589     BENVOLIO
1590     Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
1591     MERCUTIO
1592     Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
1593     how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
1594     that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
1595     kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
1596     be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
1597     Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
1598     eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
1599     Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
1600     to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
1601     fairly last night.
1602     ROMEO
1603     Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
1604     MERCUTIO
1605     The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
1606     ROMEO
1607     Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
1608     such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
1609     MERCUTIO
1610     That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
1611     constrains a man to bow in the hams.
1612     ROMEO
1613     Meaning, to court'sy.
1614     MERCUTIO
1615     Thou hast most kindly hit it.
1616     ROMEO
1617     A most courteous exposition.
1618     MERCUTIO
1619     Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
1620     ROMEO
1621     Pink for flower.
1622     MERCUTIO
1623     Right.
1624     ROMEO
1625     Why, then is my pump well flowered.
1626     MERCUTIO
1627     Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
1628     worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
1629     is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
1630     ROMEO
1631     O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
1632     singleness.
1633     MERCUTIO
1634     Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
1635     ROMEO
1636     Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
1637     MERCUTIO
1638     Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
1639     done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
1640     thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
1641     was I with you there for the goose?
1642     ROMEO
1643     Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
1644     not there for the goose.
1645     MERCUTIO
1646     I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
1647     ROMEO
1648     Nay, good goose, bite not.
1649     MERCUTIO
1650     Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
1651     sharp sauce.
1652     ROMEO
1653     And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
1654     MERCUTIO
1655     O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
1656     inch narrow to an ell broad!
1657     ROMEO
1658     I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
1659     to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
1660     MERCUTIO
1661     Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
1662     now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
1663     thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
1664     for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
1665     that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
1666     BENVOLIO
1667     Stop there, stop there.
1668     MERCUTIO
1669     Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
1670     BENVOLIO
1671     Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
1672     MERCUTIO
1673     O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
1674     for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
1675     meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
1676     ROMEO
1677     Here's goodly gear!
1678     Enter Nurse and PETER
1679     
1680     MERCUTIO
1681     A sail, a sail!
1682     BENVOLIO
1683     Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
1684     Nurse
1685     Peter!
1686     PETER
1687     Anon!
1688     Nurse
1689     My fan, Peter.
1690     MERCUTIO
1691     Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
1692     fairer face.
1693     Nurse
1694     God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
1695     MERCUTIO
1696     God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
1697     Nurse
1698     Is it good den?
1699     MERCUTIO
1700     'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
1701     dial is now upon the prick of noon.
1702     Nurse
1703     Out upon you! what a man are you!
1704     ROMEO
1705     One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
1706     mar.
1707     Nurse
1708     By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
1709     quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
1710     may find the young Romeo?
1711     ROMEO
1712     I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
1713     you have found him than he was when you sought him:
1714     I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
1715     Nurse
1716     You say well.
1717     MERCUTIO
1718     Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
1719     wisely, wisely.
1720     Nurse
1721     if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
1722     you.
1723     BENVOLIO
1724     She will indite him to some supper.
1725     MERCUTIO
1726     A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
1727     ROMEO
1728     What hast thou found?
1729     MERCUTIO
1730     No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
1731     that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
1732     Sings
1733     
1734     An old hare hoar,
1735     And an old hare hoar,
1736     Is very good meat in lent
1737     But a hare that is hoar
1738     Is too much for a score,
1739     When it hoars ere it be spent.
1740     Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
1741     to dinner, thither.
1742     ROMEO
1743     I will follow you.
1744     MERCUTIO
1745     Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
1746     Singing
1747     
1748     'lady, lady, lady.'
1749     Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
1750     
1751     Nurse
1752     Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
1753     merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
1754     ROMEO
1755     A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
1756     and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
1757     to in a month.
1758     Nurse
1759     An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
1760     down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
1761     Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
1762     Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
1763     none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
1764     too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
1765     PETER
1766     I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
1767     should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
1768     draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
1769     good quarrel, and the law on my side.
1770     Nurse
1771     Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
1772     me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
1773     and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
1774     out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
1775     but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
1776     a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
1777     kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
1778     is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
1779     with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
1780     to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
1781     ROMEO
1782     Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
1783     protest unto thee--
1784     Nurse
1785     Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
1786     Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
1787     ROMEO
1788     What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
1789     Nurse
1790     I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
1791     I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
1792     ROMEO
1793     Bid her devise
1794     Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
1795     And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
1796     Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
1797     Nurse
1798     No truly sir; not a penny.
1799     ROMEO
1800     Go to; I say you shall.
1801     Nurse
1802     This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
1803     ROMEO
1804     And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
1805     Within this hour my man shall be with thee
1806     And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
1807     Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
1808     Must be my convoy in the secret night.
1809     Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
1810     Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
1811     Nurse
1812     Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
1813     ROMEO
1814     What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
1815     Nurse
1816     Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
1817     Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
1818     ROMEO
1819     I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
1820     NURSE
1821     Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
1822     Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
1823     is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
1824     lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
1825     see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
1826     sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
1827     man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
1828     as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
1829     rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
1830     ROMEO
1831     Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
1832     Nurse
1833     Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
1834     the--No; I know it begins with some other
1835     letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
1836     it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
1837     to hear it.
1838     ROMEO
1839     Commend me to thy lady.
1840     Nurse
1841     Ay, a thousand times.
1842     Exit Romeo
1843     
1844     Peter!
1845     PETER
1846     Anon!
1847     Nurse
1848     Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
1849     Exeunt
1850     
1851     SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
1852     Enter JULIET
1853     JULIET
1854     The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
1855     In half an hour she promised to return.
1856     Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
1857     O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
1858     Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
1859     Driving back shadows over louring hills:
1860     Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
1861     And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
1862     Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
1863     Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
1864     Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
1865     Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
1866     She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
1867     My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
1868     And his to me:
1869     But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
1870     Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
1871     O God, she comes!
1872     Enter Nurse and PETER
1873     
1874     O honey nurse, what news?
1875     Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
1876     Nurse
1877     Peter, stay at the gate.
1878     Exit PETER
1879     
1880     JULIET
1881     Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
1882     Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
1883     If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
1884     By playing it to me with so sour a face.
1885     Nurse
1886     I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
1887     Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
1888     JULIET
1889     I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
1890     Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
1891     Nurse
1892     Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
1893     Do you not see that I am out of breath?
1894     JULIET
1895     How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
1896     To say to me that thou art out of breath?
1897     The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
1898     Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
1899     Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
1900     Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
1901     Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
1902     Nurse
1903     Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
1904     how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
1905     face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
1906     all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
1907     though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
1908     past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
1909     but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
1910     ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
1911     JULIET
1912     No, no: but all this did I know before.
1913     What says he of our marriage? what of that?
1914     Nurse
1915     Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
1916     It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
1917     My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
1918     Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
1919     To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
1920     JULIET
1921     I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
1922     Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
1923     Nurse
1924     Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
1925     courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
1926     warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
1927     JULIET
1928     Where is my mother! why, she is within;
1929     Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
1930     'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
1931     Where is your mother?'
1932     Nurse
1933     O God's lady dear!
1934     Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
1935     Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
1936     Henceforward do your messages yourself.
1937     JULIET
1938     Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
1939     Nurse
1940     Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
1941     JULIET
1942     I have.
1943     Nurse
1944     Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
1945     There stays a husband to make you a wife:
1946     Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
1947     They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
1948     Hie you to church; I must another way,
1949     To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
1950     Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
1951     I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
1952     But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
1953     Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
1954     JULIET
1955     Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
1956     Exeunt
1957     
1958     SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.
1959     Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO
1960     FRIAR LAURENCE
1961     So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
1962     That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
1963     ROMEO
1964     Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
1965     It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
1966     That one short minute gives me in her sight:
1967     Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
1968     Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
1969     It is enough I may but call her mine.
1970     FRIAR LAURENCE
1971     These violent delights have violent ends
1972     And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
1973     Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
1974     Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
1975     And in the taste confounds the appetite:
1976     Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
1977     Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
1978     Enter JULIET
1979     
1980     Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
1981     Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
1982     A lover may bestride the gossamer
1983     That idles in the wanton summer air,
1984     And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
1985     JULIET
1986     Good even to my ghostly confessor.
1987     FRIAR LAURENCE
1988     Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
1989     JULIET
1990     As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
1991     ROMEO
1992     Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
1993     Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
1994     To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
1995     This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
1996     Unfold the imagined happiness that both
1997     Receive in either by this dear encounter.
1998     JULIET
1999     Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
2000     Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
2001     They are but beggars that can count their worth;
2002     But my true love is grown to such excess
2003     I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
2004     FRIAR LAURENCE
2005     Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
2006     For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
2007     Till holy church incorporate two in one.
2008     Exeunt
2009     
2010     ACT III
2011     SCENE I. A public place.
2012     Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants
2013     BENVOLIO
2014     I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
2015     The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
2016     And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
2017     For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
2018     MERCUTIO
2019     Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
2020     enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
2021     upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
2022     thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
2023     it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
2024     BENVOLIO
2025     Am I like such a fellow?
2026     MERCUTIO
2027     Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
2028     any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
2029     soon moody to be moved.
2030     BENVOLIO
2031     And what to?
2032     MERCUTIO
2033     Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
2034     shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
2035     thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
2036     or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
2037     wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
2038     other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
2039     eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
2040     Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
2041     meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
2042     an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
2043     man for coughing in the street, because he hath
2044     wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
2045     didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
2046     his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
2047     tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
2048     wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
2049     BENVOLIO
2050     An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
2051     should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
2052     MERCUTIO
2053     The fee-simple! O simple!
2054     BENVOLIO
2055     By my head, here come the Capulets.
2056     MERCUTIO
2057     By my heel, I care not.
2058     Enter TYBALT and others
2059     
2060     TYBALT
2061     Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
2062     Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
2063     MERCUTIO
2064     And but one word with one of us? couple it with
2065     something; make it a word and a blow.
2066     TYBALT
2067     You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
2068     will give me occasion.
2069     MERCUTIO
2070     Could you not take some occasion without giving?
2071     TYBALT
2072     Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
2073     MERCUTIO
2074     Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
2075     thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
2076     discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
2077     make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
2078     BENVOLIO
2079     We talk here in the public haunt of men:
2080     Either withdraw unto some private place,
2081     And reason coldly of your grievances,
2082     Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
2083     MERCUTIO
2084     Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
2085     I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
2086     Enter ROMEO
2087     
2088     TYBALT
2089     Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
2090     MERCUTIO
2091     But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
2092     Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
2093     Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
2094     TYBALT
2095     Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
2096     No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
2097     ROMEO
2098     Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
2099     Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
2100     To such a greeting: villain am I none;
2101     Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
2102     TYBALT
2103     Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
2104     That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
2105     ROMEO
2106     I do protest, I never injured thee,
2107     But love thee better than thou canst devise,
2108     Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
2109     And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
2110     As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
2111     MERCUTIO
2112     O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
2113     Alla stoccata carries it away.
2114     Draws
2115     
2116     Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
2117     TYBALT
2118     What wouldst thou have with me?
2119     MERCUTIO
2120     Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
2121     lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
2122     shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
2123     eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
2124     by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
2125     ears ere it be out.
2126     TYBALT
2127     I am for you.
2128     Drawing
2129     
2130     ROMEO
2131     Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
2132     MERCUTIO
2133     Come, sir, your passado.
2134     They fight
2135     
2136     ROMEO
2137     Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
2138     Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
2139     Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
2140     Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
2141     Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
2142     TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers
2143     
2144     MERCUTIO
2145     I am hurt.
2146     A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
2147     Is he gone, and hath nothing?
2148     BENVOLIO
2149     What, art thou hurt?
2150     MERCUTIO
2151     Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
2152     Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
2153     Exit Page
2154     
2155     ROMEO
2156     Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
2157     MERCUTIO
2158     No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
2159     church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
2160     me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
2161     am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
2162     both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
2163     cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
2164     rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
2165     arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
2166     was hurt under your arm.
2167     ROMEO
2168     I thought all for the best.
2169     MERCUTIO
2170     Help me into some house, Benvolio,
2171     Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
2172     They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
2173     And soundly too: your houses!
2174     Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
2175     
2176     ROMEO
2177     This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
2178     My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
2179     In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
2180     With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
2181     Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
2182     Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
2183     And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
2184     Re-enter BENVOLIO
2185     
2186     BENVOLIO
2187     O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
2188     That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
2189     Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
2190     ROMEO
2191     This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
2192     This but begins the woe, others must end.
2193     BENVOLIO
2194     Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
2195     ROMEO
2196     Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
2197     Away to heaven, respective lenity,
2198     And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
2199     Re-enter TYBALT
2200     
2201     Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
2202     That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
2203     Is but a little way above our heads,
2204     Staying for thine to keep him company:
2205     Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
2206     TYBALT
2207     Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
2208     Shalt with him hence.
2209     ROMEO
2210     This shall determine that.
2211     They fight; TYBALT falls
2212     
2213     BENVOLIO
2214     Romeo, away, be gone!
2215     The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
2216     Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
2217     If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
2218     ROMEO
2219     O, I am fortune's fool!
2220     BENVOLIO
2221     Why dost thou stay?
2222     Exit ROMEO
2223     
2224     Enter Citizens, & c
2225     
2226     First Citizen
2227     Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
2228     Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
2229     BENVOLIO
2230     There lies that Tybalt.
2231     First Citizen
2232     Up, sir, go with me;
2233     I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
2234     Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others
2235     
2236     PRINCE
2237     Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
2238     BENVOLIO
2239     O noble prince, I can discover all
2240     The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
2241     There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
2242     That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
2243     LADY CAPULET
2244     Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
2245     O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
2246     O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
2247     For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
2248     O cousin, cousin!
2249     PRINCE
2250     Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
2251     BENVOLIO
2252     Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
2253     Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
2254     How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
2255     Your high displeasure: all this uttered
2256     With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
2257     Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
2258     Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
2259     With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
2260     Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
2261     And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
2262     Cold death aside, and with the other sends
2263     It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
2264     Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
2265     'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
2266     his tongue,
2267     His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
2268     And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
2269     An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
2270     Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
2271     But by and by comes back to Romeo,
2272     Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
2273     And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
2274     Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
2275     And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
2276     This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
2277     LADY CAPULET
2278     He is a kinsman to the Montague;
2279     Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
2280     Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
2281     And all those twenty could but kill one life.
2282     I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
2283     Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
2284     PRINCE
2285     Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
2286     Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
2287     MONTAGUE
2288     Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
2289     His fault concludes but what the law should end,
2290     The life of Tybalt.
2291     PRINCE
2292     And for that offence
2293     Immediately we do exile him hence:
2294     I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
2295     My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
2296     But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
2297     That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
2298     I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
2299     Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
2300     Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
2301     Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
2302     Bear hence this body and attend our will:
2303     Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
2304     Exeunt
2305     
2306     SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
2307     Enter JULIET
2308     JULIET
2309     Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
2310     Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
2311     As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
2312     And bring in cloudy night immediately.
2313     Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
2314     That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
2315     Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
2316     Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
2317     By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
2318     It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
2319     Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
2320     And learn me how to lose a winning match,
2321     Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
2322     Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
2323     With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
2324     Think true love acted simple modesty.
2325     Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
2326     For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
2327     Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
2328     Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
2329     Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
2330     Take him and cut him out in little stars,
2331     And he will make the face of heaven so fine
2332     That all the world will be in love with night
2333     And pay no worship to the garish sun.
2334     O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
2335     But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
2336     Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
2337     As is the night before some festival
2338     To an impatient child that hath new robes
2339     And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
2340     And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
2341     But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
2342     Enter Nurse, with cords
2343     
2344     Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
2345     That Romeo bid thee fetch?
2346     Nurse
2347     Ay, ay, the cords.
2348     Throws them down
2349     
2350     JULIET
2351     Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
2352     Nurse
2353     Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
2354     We are undone, lady, we are undone!
2355     Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
2356     JULIET
2357     Can heaven be so envious?
2358     Nurse
2359     Romeo can,
2360     Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
2361     Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
2362     JULIET
2363     What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
2364     This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
2365     Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
2366     And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
2367     Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
2368     I am not I, if there be such an I;
2369     Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
2370     If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
2371     Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
2372     Nurse
2373     I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
2374     God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
2375     A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
2376     Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
2377     All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
2378     JULIET
2379     O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
2380     To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
2381     Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
2382     And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
2383     Nurse
2384     O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
2385     O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
2386     That ever I should live to see thee dead!
2387     JULIET
2388     What storm is this that blows so contrary?
2389     Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
2390     My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
2391     Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
2392     For who is living, if those two are gone?
2393     Nurse
2394     Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
2395     Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
2396     JULIET
2397     O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
2398     Nurse
2399     It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
2400     JULIET
2401     O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
2402     Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
2403     Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
2404     Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
2405     Despised substance of divinest show!
2406     Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
2407     A damned saint, an honourable villain!
2408     O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
2409     When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
2410     In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
2411     Was ever book containing such vile matter
2412     So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
2413     In such a gorgeous palace!
2414     Nurse
2415     There's no trust,
2416     No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
2417     All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
2418     Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
2419     These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
2420     Shame come to Romeo!
2421     JULIET
2422     Blister'd be thy tongue
2423     For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
2424     Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
2425     For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
2426     Sole monarch of the universal earth.
2427     O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
2428     Nurse
2429     Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
2430     JULIET
2431     Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
2432     Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
2433     When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
2434     But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
2435     That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
2436     Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
2437     Your tributary drops belong to woe,
2438     Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
2439     My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
2440     And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
2441     All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
2442     Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
2443     That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
2444     But, O, it presses to my memory,
2445     Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
2446     'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
2447     That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
2448     Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
2449     Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
2450     Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
2451     And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
2452     Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
2453     Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
2454     Which modern lamentations might have moved?
2455     But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
2456     'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
2457     Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
2458     All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
2459     There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
2460     In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
2461     Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
2462     Nurse
2463     Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
2464     Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
2465     JULIET
2466     Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
2467     When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
2468     Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
2469     Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
2470     He made you for a highway to my bed;
2471     But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
2472     Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
2473     And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
2474     Nurse
2475     Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
2476     To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
2477     Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
2478     I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
2479     JULIET
2480     O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
2481     And bid him come to take his last farewell.
2482     Exeunt
2483     
2484     SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
2485     Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
2486     FRIAR LAURENCE
2487     Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
2488     Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
2489     And thou art wedded to calamity.
2490     Enter ROMEO
2491     
2492     ROMEO
2493     Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
2494     What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
2495     That I yet know not?
2496     FRIAR LAURENCE
2497     Too familiar
2498     Is my dear son with such sour company:
2499     I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
2500     ROMEO
2501     What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
2502     FRIAR LAURENCE
2503     A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
2504     Not body's death, but body's banishment.
2505     ROMEO
2506     Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
2507     For exile hath more terror in his look,
2508     Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
2509     FRIAR LAURENCE
2510     Hence from Verona art thou banished:
2511     Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
2512     ROMEO
2513     There is no world without Verona walls,
2514     But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
2515     Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
2516     And world's exile is death: then banished,
2517     Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
2518     Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
2519     And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
2520     FRIAR LAURENCE
2521     O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
2522     Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
2523     Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
2524     And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
2525     This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
2526     ROMEO
2527     'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
2528     Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
2529     And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
2530     Live here in heaven and may look on her;
2531     But Romeo may not: more validity,
2532     More honourable state, more courtship lives
2533     In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
2534     On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
2535     And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
2536     Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
2537     Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
2538     But Romeo may not; he is banished:
2539     Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
2540     They are free men, but I am banished.
2541     And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
2542     Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
2543     No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
2544     But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
2545     O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
2546     Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
2547     Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
2548     A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
2549     To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
2550     FRIAR LAURENCE
2551     Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
2552     ROMEO
2553     O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
2554     FRIAR LAURENCE
2555     I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
2556     Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
2557     To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
2558     ROMEO
2559     Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
2560     Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
2561     Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
2562     It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
2563     FRIAR LAURENCE
2564     O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
2565     ROMEO
2566     How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
2567     FRIAR LAURENCE
2568     Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
2569     ROMEO
2570     Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
2571     Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
2572     An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
2573     Doting like me and like me banished,
2574     Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
2575     And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
2576     Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
2577     Knocking within
2578     
2579     FRIAR LAURENCE
2580     Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
2581     ROMEO
2582     Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
2583     Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
2584     Knocking
2585     
2586     FRIAR LAURENCE
2587     Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
2588     Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
2589     Knocking
2590     
2591     Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
2592     What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
2593     Knocking
2594     
2595     Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
2596     Nurse
2597     [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
2598     my errand;
2599     I come from Lady Juliet.
2600     FRIAR LAURENCE
2601     Welcome, then.
2602     Enter Nurse
2603     
2604     Nurse
2605     O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
2606     Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
2607     FRIAR LAURENCE
2608     There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
2609     Nurse
2610     O, he is even in my mistress' case,
2611     Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
2612     Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
2613     Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
2614     Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
2615     For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
2616     Why should you fall into so deep an O?
2617     ROMEO
2618     Nurse!
2619     Nurse
2620     Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
2621     ROMEO
2622     Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
2623     Doth she not think me an old murderer,
2624     Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
2625     With blood removed but little from her own?
2626     Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
2627     My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
2628     Nurse
2629     O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
2630     And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
2631     And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
2632     And then down falls again.
2633     ROMEO
2634     As if that name,
2635     Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
2636     Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
2637     Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
2638     In what vile part of this anatomy
2639     Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
2640     The hateful mansion.
2641     Drawing his sword
2642     
2643     FRIAR LAURENCE
2644     Hold thy desperate hand:
2645     Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
2646     Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
2647     The unreasonable fury of a beast:
2648     Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
2649     Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
2650     Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
2651     I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
2652     Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
2653     And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
2654     By doing damned hate upon thyself?
2655     Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
2656     Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
2657     In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
2658     Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
2659     Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
2660     And usest none in that true use indeed
2661     Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
2662     Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
2663     Digressing from the valour of a man;
2664     Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
2665     Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
2666     Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
2667     Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
2668     Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
2669     Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
2670     And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
2671     What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
2672     For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
2673     There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
2674     But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
2675     The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
2676     And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
2677     A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
2678     Happiness courts thee in her best array;
2679     But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
2680     Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
2681     Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
2682     Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
2683     Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
2684     But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
2685     For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
2686     Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
2687     To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
2688     Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
2689     With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
2690     Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
2691     Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
2692     And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
2693     Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
2694     Romeo is coming.
2695     Nurse
2696     O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
2697     To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
2698     My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
2699     ROMEO
2700     Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
2701     Nurse
2702     Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
2703     Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
2704     Exit
2705     
2706     ROMEO
2707     How well my comfort is revived by this!
2708     FRIAR LAURENCE
2709     Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
2710     Either be gone before the watch be set,
2711     Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
2712     Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
2713     And he shall signify from time to time
2714     Every good hap to you that chances here:
2715     Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
2716     ROMEO
2717     But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
2718     It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
2719     Exeunt
2720     
2721     SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.
2722     Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS
2723     CAPULET
2724     Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
2725     That we have had no time to move our daughter:
2726     Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
2727     And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
2728     'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
2729     I promise you, but for your company,
2730     I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
2731     PARIS
2732     These times of woe afford no time to woo.
2733     Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
2734     LADY CAPULET
2735     I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
2736     To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
2737     CAPULET
2738     Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
2739     Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
2740     In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
2741     Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
2742     Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
2743     And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
2744     But, soft! what day is this?
2745     PARIS
2746     Monday, my lord,
2747     CAPULET
2748     Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
2749     O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
2750     She shall be married to this noble earl.
2751     Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
2752     We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
2753     For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
2754     It may be thought we held him carelessly,
2755     Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
2756     Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
2757     And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
2758     PARIS
2759     My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
2760     CAPULET
2761     Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
2762     Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
2763     Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
2764     Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
2765     Afore me! it is so very very late,
2766     That we may call it early by and by.
2767     Good night.
2768     Exeunt
2769     
2770     SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
2771     Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window
2772     JULIET
2773     Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
2774     It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
2775     That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
2776     Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
2777     Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
2778     ROMEO
2779     It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
2780     No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
2781     Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
2782     Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
2783     Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
2784     I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
2785     JULIET
2786     Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
2787     It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
2788     To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
2789     And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
2790     Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
2791     ROMEO
2792     Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
2793     I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
2794     I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
2795     'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
2796     Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
2797     The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
2798     I have more care to stay than will to go:
2799     Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
2800     How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
2801     JULIET
2802     It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
2803     It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
2804     Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
2805     Some say the lark makes sweet division;
2806     This doth not so, for she divideth us:
2807     Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
2808     O, now I would they had changed voices too!
2809     Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
2810     Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
2811     O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
2812     ROMEO
2813     More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
2814     Enter Nurse, to the chamber
2815     
2816     Nurse
2817     Madam!
2818     JULIET
2819     Nurse?
2820     Nurse
2821     Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
2822     The day is broke; be wary, look about.
2823     Exit
2824     
2825     JULIET
2826     Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
2827     ROMEO
2828     Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
2829     He goeth down
2830     
2831     JULIET
2832     Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
2833     I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
2834     For in a minute there are many days:
2835     O, by this count I shall be much in years
2836     Ere I again behold my Romeo!
2837     ROMEO
2838     Farewell!
2839     I will omit no opportunity
2840     That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
2841     JULIET
2842     O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
2843     ROMEO
2844     I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
2845     For sweet discourses in our time to come.
2846     JULIET
2847     O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
2848     Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
2849     As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
2850     Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
2851     ROMEO
2852     And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
2853     Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
2854     Exit
2855     
2856     JULIET
2857     O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
2858     If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
2859     That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
2860     For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
2861     But send him back.
2862     LADY CAPULET
2863     [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
2864     JULIET
2865     Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
2866     Is she not down so late, or up so early?
2867     What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
2868     Enter LADY CAPULET
2869     
2870     LADY CAPULET
2871     Why, how now, Juliet!
2872     JULIET
2873     Madam, I am not well.
2874     LADY CAPULET
2875     Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
2876     What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
2877     An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
2878     Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
2879     But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
2880     JULIET
2881     Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
2882     LADY CAPULET
2883     So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
2884     Which you weep for.
2885     JULIET
2886     Feeling so the loss,
2887     Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
2888     LADY CAPULET
2889     Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
2890     As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
2891     JULIET
2892     What villain madam?
2893     LADY CAPULET
2894     That same villain, Romeo.
2895     JULIET
2896     [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
2897     God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
2898     And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
2899     LADY CAPULET
2900     That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
2901     JULIET
2902     Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
2903     Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
2904     LADY CAPULET
2905     We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
2906     Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
2907     Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
2908     Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
2909     That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
2910     And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
2911     JULIET
2912     Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
2913     With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
2914     Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
2915     Madam, if you could find out but a man
2916     To bear a poison, I would temper it;
2917     That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
2918     Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
2919     To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
2920     To wreak the love I bore my cousin
2921     Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
2922     LADY CAPULET
2923     Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
2924     But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
2925     JULIET
2926     And joy comes well in such a needy time:
2927     What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
2928     LADY CAPULET
2929     Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
2930     One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
2931     Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
2932     That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
2933     JULIET
2934     Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
2935     LADY CAPULET
2936     Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
2937     The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
2938     The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
2939     Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
2940     JULIET
2941     Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
2942     He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
2943     I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
2944     Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
2945     I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
2946     I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
2947     It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
2948     Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
2949     LADY CAPULET
2950     Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
2951     And see how he will take it at your hands.
2952     Enter CAPULET and Nurse
2953     
2954     CAPULET
2955     When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
2956     But for the sunset of my brother's son
2957     It rains downright.
2958     How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
2959     Evermore showering? In one little body
2960     Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
2961     For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
2962     Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
2963     Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
2964     Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
2965     Without a sudden calm, will overset
2966     Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
2967     Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
2968     LADY CAPULET
2969     Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
2970     I would the fool were married to her grave!
2971     CAPULET
2972     Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
2973     How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
2974     Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
2975     Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
2976     So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
2977     JULIET
2978     Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
2979     Proud can I never be of what I hate;
2980     But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
2981     CAPULET
2982     How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
2983     'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
2984     And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
2985     Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
2986     But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
2987     To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
2988     Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
2989     Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
2990     You tallow-face!
2991     LADY CAPULET
2992     Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
2993     JULIET
2994     Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
2995     Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
2996     CAPULET
2997     Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
2998     I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
2999     Or never after look me in the face:
3000     Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
3001     My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
3002     That God had lent us but this only child;
3003     But now I see this one is one too much,
3004     And that we have a curse in having her:
3005     Out on her, hilding!
3006     Nurse
3007     God in heaven bless her!
3008     You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
3009     CAPULET
3010     And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
3011     Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
3012     Nurse
3013     I speak no treason.
3014     CAPULET
3015     O, God ye god-den.
3016     Nurse
3017     May not one speak?
3018     CAPULET
3019     Peace, you mumbling fool!
3020     Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
3021     For here we need it not.
3022     LADY CAPULET
3023     You are too hot.
3024     CAPULET
3025     God's bread! it makes me mad:
3026     Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
3027     Alone, in company, still my care hath been
3028     To have her match'd: and having now provided
3029     A gentleman of noble parentage,
3030     Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
3031     Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
3032     Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
3033     And then to have a wretched puling fool,
3034     A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
3035     To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
3036     I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
3037     But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
3038     Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
3039     Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
3040     Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
3041     An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
3042     And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
3043     the streets,
3044     For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
3045     Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
3046     Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
3047     Exit
3048     
3049     JULIET
3050     Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
3051     That sees into the bottom of my grief?
3052     O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
3053     Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
3054     Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
3055     In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
3056     LADY CAPULET
3057     Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
3058     Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
3059     Exit
3060     
3061     JULIET
3062     O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
3063     My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
3064     How shall that faith return again to earth,
3065     Unless that husband send it me from heaven
3066     By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
3067     Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
3068     Upon so soft a subject as myself!
3069     What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
3070     Some comfort, nurse.
3071     Nurse
3072     Faith, here it is.
3073     Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
3074     That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
3075     Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
3076     Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
3077     I think it best you married with the county.
3078     O, he's a lovely gentleman!
3079     Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
3080     Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
3081     As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
3082     I think you are happy in this second match,
3083     For it excels your first: or if it did not,
3084     Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
3085     As living here and you no use of him.
3086     JULIET
3087     Speakest thou from thy heart?
3088     Nurse
3089     And from my soul too;
3090     Or else beshrew them both.
3091     JULIET
3092     Amen!
3093     Nurse
3094     What?
3095     JULIET
3096     Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
3097     Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
3098     Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
3099     To make confession and to be absolved.
3100     Nurse
3101     Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
3102     Exit
3103     
3104     JULIET
3105     Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
3106     Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
3107     Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
3108     Which she hath praised him with above compare
3109     So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
3110     Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
3111     I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
3112     If all else fail, myself have power to die.
3113     Exit
3114     
3115     ACT IV
3116     SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.
3117     Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
3118     FRIAR LAURENCE
3119     On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
3120     PARIS
3121     My father Capulet will have it so;
3122     And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
3123     FRIAR LAURENCE
3124     You say you do not know the lady's mind:
3125     Uneven is the course, I like it not.
3126     PARIS
3127     Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
3128     And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
3129     For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
3130     Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
3131     That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
3132     And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
3133     To stop the inundation of her tears;
3134     Which, too much minded by herself alone,
3135     May be put from her by society:
3136     Now do you know the reason of this haste.
3137     FRIAR LAURENCE
3138     [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
3139     Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
3140     Enter JULIET
3141     
3142     PARIS
3143     Happily met, my lady and my wife!
3144     JULIET
3145     That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
3146     PARIS
3147     That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
3148     JULIET
3149     What must be shall be.
3150     FRIAR LAURENCE
3151     That's a certain text.
3152     PARIS
3153     Come you to make confession to this father?
3154     JULIET
3155     To answer that, I should confess to you.
3156     PARIS
3157     Do not deny to him that you love me.
3158     JULIET
3159     I will confess to you that I love him.
3160     PARIS
3161     So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
3162     JULIET
3163     If I do so, it will be of more price,
3164     Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
3165     PARIS
3166     Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
3167     JULIET
3168     The tears have got small victory by that;
3169     For it was bad enough before their spite.
3170     PARIS
3171     Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
3172     JULIET
3173     That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
3174     And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
3175     PARIS
3176     Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
3177     JULIET
3178     It may be so, for it is not mine own.
3179     Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
3180     Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
3181     FRIAR LAURENCE
3182     My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
3183     My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
3184     PARIS
3185     God shield I should disturb devotion!
3186     Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
3187     Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
3188     Exit
3189     
3190     JULIET
3191     O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
3192     Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
3193     FRIAR LAURENCE
3194     Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
3195     It strains me past the compass of my wits:
3196     I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
3197     On Thursday next be married to this county.
3198     JULIET
3199     Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
3200     Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
3201     If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
3202     Do thou but call my resolution wise,
3203     And with this knife I'll help it presently.
3204     God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
3205     And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
3206     Shall be the label to another deed,
3207     Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
3208     Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
3209     Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
3210     Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
3211     'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
3212     Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
3213     Which the commission of thy years and art
3214     Could to no issue of true honour bring.
3215     Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
3216     If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
3217     FRIAR LAURENCE
3218     Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
3219     Which craves as desperate an execution.
3220     As that is desperate which we would prevent.
3221     If, rather than to marry County Paris,
3222     Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
3223     Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
3224     A thing like death to chide away this shame,
3225     That copest with death himself to scape from it:
3226     And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
3227     JULIET
3228     O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
3229     From off the battlements of yonder tower;
3230     Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
3231     Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
3232     Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
3233     O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
3234     With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
3235     Or bid me go into a new-made grave
3236     And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
3237     Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
3238     And I will do it without fear or doubt,
3239     To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
3240     FRIAR LAURENCE
3241     Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
3242     To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
3243     To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
3244     Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
3245     Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
3246     And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
3247     When presently through all thy veins shall run
3248     A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
3249     Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
3250     No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
3251     The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
3252     To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
3253     Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
3254     Each part, deprived of supple government,
3255     Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
3256     And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
3257     Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
3258     And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
3259     Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
3260     To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
3261     Then, as the manner of our country is,
3262     In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
3263     Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
3264     Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
3265     In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
3266     Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
3267     And hither shall he come: and he and I
3268     Will watch thy waking, and that very night
3269     Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
3270     And this shall free thee from this present shame;
3271     If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
3272     Abate thy valour in the acting it.
3273     JULIET
3274     Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
3275     FRIAR LAURENCE
3276     Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
3277     In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
3278     To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
3279     JULIET
3280     Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
3281     Farewell, dear father!
3282     Exeunt
3283     
3284     SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.
3285     Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen
3286     CAPULET
3287     So many guests invite as here are writ.
3288     Exit First Servant
3289     
3290     Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
3291     Second Servant
3292     You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
3293     can lick their fingers.
3294     CAPULET
3295     How canst thou try them so?
3296     Second Servant
3297     Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
3298     own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
3299     fingers goes not with me.
3300     CAPULET
3301     Go, be gone.
3302     Exit Second Servant
3303     
3304     We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
3305     What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
3306     Nurse
3307     Ay, forsooth.
3308     CAPULET
3309     Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
3310     A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
3311     Nurse
3312     See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
3313     Enter JULIET
3314     
3315     CAPULET
3316     How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
3317     JULIET
3318     Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
3319     Of disobedient opposition
3320     To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
3321     By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
3322     And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
3323     Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
3324     CAPULET
3325     Send for the county; go tell him of this:
3326     I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
3327     JULIET
3328     I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
3329     And gave him what becomed love I might,
3330     Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
3331     CAPULET
3332     Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
3333     This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
3334     Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
3335     Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
3336     Our whole city is much bound to him.
3337     JULIET
3338     Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
3339     To help me sort such needful ornaments
3340     As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
3341     LADY CAPULET
3342     No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
3343     CAPULET
3344     Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
3345     Exeunt JULIET and Nurse
3346     
3347     LADY CAPULET
3348     We shall be short in our provision:
3349     'Tis now near night.
3350     CAPULET
3351     Tush, I will stir about,
3352     And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
3353     Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
3354     I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
3355     I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
3356     They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
3357     To County Paris, to prepare him up
3358     Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
3359     Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
3360     Exeunt
3361     
3362     SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.
3363     Enter JULIET and Nurse
3364     JULIET
3365     Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
3366     I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
3367     For I have need of many orisons
3368     To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
3369     Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
3370     Enter LADY CAPULET
3371     
3372     LADY CAPULET
3373     What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
3374     JULIET
3375     No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
3376     As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
3377     So please you, let me now be left alone,
3378     And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
3379     For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
3380     In this so sudden business.
3381     LADY CAPULET
3382     Good night:
3383     Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
3384     Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse
3385     
3386     JULIET
3387     Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
3388     I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
3389     That almost freezes up the heat of life:
3390     I'll call them back again to comfort me:
3391     Nurse! What should she do here?
3392     My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
3393     Come, vial.
3394     What if this mixture do not work at all?
3395     Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
3396     No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
3397     Laying down her dagger
3398     
3399     What if it be a poison, which the friar
3400     Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
3401     Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
3402     Because he married me before to Romeo?
3403     I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
3404     For he hath still been tried a holy man.
3405     How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
3406     I wake before the time that Romeo
3407     Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
3408     Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
3409     To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
3410     And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
3411     Or, if I live, is it not very like,
3412     The horrible conceit of death and night,
3413     Together with the terror of the place,--
3414     As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
3415     Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
3416     Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
3417     Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
3418     Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
3419     At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
3420     Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
3421     So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
3422     And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
3423     That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
3424     O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
3425     Environed with all these hideous fears?
3426     And madly play with my forefather's joints?
3427     And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
3428     And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
3429     As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
3430     O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
3431     Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
3432     Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
3433     Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
3434     She falls upon her bed, within the curtains
3435     
3436     SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet's house.
3437     Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
3438     LADY CAPULET
3439     Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
3440     Nurse
3441     They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
3442     Enter CAPULET
3443     
3444     CAPULET
3445     Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
3446     The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
3447     Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
3448     Spare not for the cost.
3449     Nurse
3450     Go, you cot-quean, go,
3451     Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
3452     For this night's watching.
3453     CAPULET
3454     No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
3455     All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
3456     LADY CAPULET
3457     Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
3458     But I will watch you from such watching now.
3459     Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse
3460     
3461     CAPULET
3462     A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
3463     Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets
3464     
3465     Now, fellow,
3466     What's there?
3467     First Servant
3468     Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
3469     CAPULET
3470     Make haste, make haste.
3471     Exit First Servant
3472     
3473     Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
3474     Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
3475     Second Servant
3476     I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
3477     And never trouble Peter for the matter.
3478     Exit
3479     
3480     CAPULET
3481     Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
3482     Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
3483     The county will be here with music straight,
3484     For so he said he would: I hear him near.
3485     Music within
3486     
3487     Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
3488     Re-enter Nurse
3489     
3490     Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
3491     I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
3492     Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
3493     Make haste, I say.
3494     Exeunt
3495     
3496     SCENE V. Juliet's chamber.
3497     Enter Nurse
3498     Nurse
3499     Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
3500     Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
3501     Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
3502     What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
3503     Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
3504     The County Paris hath set up his rest,
3505     That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
3506     Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
3507     I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
3508     Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
3509     He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
3510     Undraws the curtains
3511     
3512     What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
3513     I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
3514     Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
3515     O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
3516     Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
3517     Enter LADY CAPULET
3518     
3519     LADY CAPULET
3520     What noise is here?
3521     Nurse
3522     O lamentable day!
3523     LADY CAPULET
3524     What is the matter?
3525     Nurse
3526     Look, look! O heavy day!
3527     LADY CAPULET
3528     O me, O me! My child, my only life,
3529     Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
3530     Help, help! Call help.
3531     Enter CAPULET
3532     
3533     CAPULET
3534     For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
3535     Nurse
3536     She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!
3537     LADY CAPULET
3538     Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
3539     CAPULET
3540     Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
3541     Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
3542     Life and these lips have long been separated:
3543     Death lies on her like an untimely frost
3544     Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
3545     Nurse
3546     O lamentable day!
3547     LADY CAPULET
3548     O woful time!
3549     CAPULET
3550     Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
3551     Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
3552     Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians
3553     
3554     FRIAR LAURENCE
3555     Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
3556     CAPULET
3557     Ready to go, but never to return.
3558     O son! the night before thy wedding-day
3559     Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
3560     Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
3561     Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
3562     My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
3563     And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
3564     PARIS
3565     Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
3566     And doth it give me such a sight as this?
3567     LADY CAPULET
3568     Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
3569     Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
3570     In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
3571     But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
3572     But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
3573     And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
3574     Nurse
3575     O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
3576     Most lamentable day, most woful day,
3577     That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
3578     O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
3579     Never was seen so black a day as this:
3580     O woful day, O woful day!
3581     PARIS
3582     Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
3583     Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
3584     By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
3585     O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
3586     CAPULET
3587     Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
3588     Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
3589     To murder, murder our solemnity?
3590     O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
3591     Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
3592     And with my child my joys are buried.
3593     FRIAR LAURENCE
3594     Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
3595     In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
3596     Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
3597     And all the better is it for the maid:
3598     Your part in her you could not keep from death,
3599     But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
3600     The most you sought was her promotion;
3601     For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
3602     And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
3603     Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
3604     O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
3605     That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
3606     She's not well married that lives married long;
3607     But she's best married that dies married young.
3608     Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
3609     On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
3610     In all her best array bear her to church:
3611     For though fond nature bids us an lament,
3612     Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
3613     CAPULET
3614     All things that we ordained festival,
3615     Turn from their office to black funeral;
3616     Our instruments to melancholy bells,
3617     Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
3618     Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
3619     Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
3620     And all things change them to the contrary.
3621     FRIAR LAURENCE
3622     Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
3623     And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
3624     To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
3625     The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
3626     Move them no more by crossing their high will.
3627     Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE
3628     
3629     First Musician
3630     Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
3631     Nurse
3632     Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
3633     For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
3634     Exit
3635     
3636     First Musician
3637     Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
3638     Enter PETER
3639     
3640     PETER
3641     Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
3642     ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
3643     First Musician
3644     Why 'Heart's ease?'
3645     PETER
3646     O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
3647     heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
3648     to comfort me.
3649     First Musician
3650     Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
3651     PETER
3652     You will not, then?
3653     First Musician
3654     No.
3655     PETER
3656     I will then give it you soundly.
3657     First Musician
3658     What will you give us?
3659     PETER
3660     No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
3661     I will give you the minstrel.
3662     First Musician
3663     Then I will give you the serving-creature.
3664     PETER
3665     Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
3666     your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
3667     I'll fa you; do you note me?
3668     First Musician
3669     An you re us and fa us, you note us.
3670     Second Musician
3671     Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
3672     PETER
3673     Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
3674     with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
3675     me like men:
3676     'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
3677     And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
3678     Then music with her silver sound'--
3679     why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
3680     sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
3681     Musician
3682     Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
3683     PETER
3684     Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
3685     Second Musician
3686     I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
3687     PETER
3688     Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
3689     Third Musician
3690     Faith, I know not what to say.
3691     PETER
3692     O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
3693     for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
3694     because musicians have no gold for sounding:
3695     'Then music with her silver sound
3696     With speedy help doth lend redress.'
3697     Exit
3698     
3699     First Musician
3700     What a pestilent knave is this same!
3701     Second Musician
3702     Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
3703     mourners, and stay dinner.
3704     Exeunt

3706     ACT V
3707     SCENE I. Mantua. A street.
3708     Enter ROMEO
3709     ROMEO
3710     If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
3711     My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
3712     My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
3713     And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
3714     Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
3715     I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
3716     Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
3717     to think!--
3718     And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
3719     That I revived, and was an emperor.
3720     Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
3721     When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
3722     Enter BALTHASAR, booted
3723     
3724     News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
3725     Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
3726     How doth my lady? Is my father well?
3727     How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
3728     For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
3729     BALTHASAR
3730     Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
3731     Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
3732     And her immortal part with angels lives.
3733     I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
3734     And presently took post to tell it you:
3735     O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
3736     Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
3737     ROMEO
3738     Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
3739     Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
3740     And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
3741     BALTHASAR
3742     I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
3743     Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
3744     Some misadventure.
3745     ROMEO
3746     Tush, thou art deceived:
3747     Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
3748     Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
3749     BALTHASAR
3750     No, my good lord.
3751     ROMEO
3752     No matter: get thee gone,
3753     And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
3754     Exit BALTHASAR
3755     
3756     Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
3757     Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
3758     To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
3759     I do remember an apothecary,--
3760     And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
3761     In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
3762     Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
3763     Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
3764     And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
3765     An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
3766     Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
3767     A beggarly account of empty boxes,
3768     Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
3769     Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
3770     Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
3771     Noting this penury, to myself I said
3772     'An if a man did need a poison now,
3773     Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
3774     Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
3775     O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
3776     And this same needy man must sell it me.
3777     As I remember, this should be the house.
3778     Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
3779     What, ho! apothecary!
3780     Enter Apothecary
3781     
3782     Apothecary
3783     Who calls so loud?
3784     ROMEO
3785     Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
3786     Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
3787     A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
3788     As will disperse itself through all the veins
3789     That the life-weary taker may fall dead
3790     And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
3791     As violently as hasty powder fired
3792     Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
3793     Apothecary
3794     Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
3795     Is death to any he that utters them.
3796     ROMEO
3797     Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
3798     And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
3799     Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
3800     Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
3801     The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
3802     The world affords no law to make thee rich;
3803     Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
3804     Apothecary
3805     My poverty, but not my will, consents.
3806     ROMEO
3807     I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
3808     Apothecary
3809     Put this in any liquid thing you will,
3810     And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
3811     Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
3812     ROMEO
3813     There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
3814     Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
3815     Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
3816     I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
3817     Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
3818     Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
3819     To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
3820     Exeunt
3821     
3822     SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.
3823     Enter FRIAR JOHN
3824     FRIAR JOHN
3825     Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
3826     Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
3827     
3828     FRIAR LAURENCE
3829     This same should be the voice of Friar John.
3830     Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
3831     Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
3832     FRIAR JOHN
3833     Going to find a bare-foot brother out
3834     One of our order, to associate me,
3835     Here in this city visiting the sick,
3836     And finding him, the searchers of the town,
3837     Suspecting that we both were in a house
3838     Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
3839     Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
3840     So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
3841     FRIAR LAURENCE
3842     Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
3843     FRIAR JOHN
3844     I could not send it,--here it is again,--
3845     Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
3846     So fearful were they of infection.
3847     FRIAR LAURENCE
3848     Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
3849     The letter was not nice but full of charge
3850     Of dear import, and the neglecting it
3851     May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
3852     Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
3853     Unto my cell.
3854     FRIAR JOHN
3855     Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
3856     Exit
3857     
3858     FRIAR LAURENCE
3859     Now must I to the monument alone;
3860     Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
3861     She will beshrew me much that Romeo
3862     Hath had no notice of these accidents;
3863     But I will write again to Mantua,
3864     And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
3865     Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
3866     Exit
3867     
3868     SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.
3869     Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch
3870     PARIS
3871     Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
3872     Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
3873     Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
3874     Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
3875     So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
3876     Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
3877     But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
3878     As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
3879     Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
3880     PAGE
3881     [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
3882     Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
3883     Retires
3884     
3885     PARIS
3886     Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
3887     O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
3888     Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
3889     Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
3890     The obsequies that I for thee will keep
3891     Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
3892     The Page whistles
3893     
3894     The boy gives warning something doth approach.
3895     What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
3896     To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
3897     What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
3898     Retires
3899     
3900     Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & c
3901     
3902     ROMEO
3903     Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
3904     Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
3905     See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
3906     Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
3907     Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
3908     And do not interrupt me in my course.
3909     Why I descend into this bed of death,
3910     Is partly to behold my lady's face;
3911     But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
3912     A precious ring, a ring that I must use
3913     In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
3914     But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
3915     In what I further shall intend to do,
3916     By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
3917     And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
3918     The time and my intents are savage-wild,
3919     More fierce and more inexorable far
3920     Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
3921     BALTHASAR
3922     I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
3923     ROMEO
3924     So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
3925     Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
3926     BALTHASAR
3927     [Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
3928     His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
3929     Retires
3930     
3931     ROMEO
3932     Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
3933     Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
3934     Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
3935     And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
3936     Opens the tomb
3937     
3938     PARIS
3939     This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
3940     That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
3941     It is supposed, the fair creature died;
3942     And here is come to do some villanous shame
3943     To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
3944     Comes forward
3945     
3946     Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
3947     Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
3948     Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
3949     Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
3950     ROMEO
3951     I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
3952     Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
3953     Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
3954     Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
3955     Put not another sin upon my head,
3956     By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
3957     By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
3958     For I come hither arm'd against myself:
3959     Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
3960     A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
3961     PARIS
3962     I do defy thy conjurations,
3963     And apprehend thee for a felon here.
3964     ROMEO
3965     Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
3966     They fight
3967     
3968     PAGE
3969     O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
3970     Exit
3971     
3972     PARIS
3973     O, I am slain!
3974     Falls
3975     
3976     If thou be merciful,
3977     Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
3978     Dies
3979     
3980     ROMEO
3981     In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
3982     Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
3983     What said my man, when my betossed soul
3984     Did not attend him as we rode? I think
3985     He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
3986     Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
3987     Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
3988     To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
3989     One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
3990     I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
3991     A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
3992     For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
3993     This vault a feasting presence full of light.
3994     Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
3995     Laying PARIS in the tomb
3996     
3997     How oft when men are at the point of death
3998     Have they been merry! which their keepers call
3999     A lightning before death: O, how may I
4000     Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
4001     Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
4002     Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
4003     Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
4004     Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
4005     And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
4006     Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
4007     O, what more favour can I do to thee,
4008     Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
4009     To sunder his that was thine enemy?
4010     Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
4011     Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
4012     That unsubstantial death is amorous,
4013     And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
4014     Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
4015     For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
4016     And never from this palace of dim night
4017     Depart again: here, here will I remain
4018     With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
4019     Will I set up my everlasting rest,
4020     And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
4021     From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
4022     Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
4023     The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
4024     A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
4025     Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
4026     Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
4027     The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
4028     Here's to my love!
4029     Drinks
4030     
4031     O true apothecary!
4032     Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

4034     
4035     Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade
4036     
4037     FRIAR LAURENCE
4038     Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
4039     Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
4040     BALTHASAR
4041     Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
4042     FRIAR LAURENCE
4043     Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
4044     What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
4045     To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
4046     It burneth in the Capel's monument.
4047     BALTHASAR
4048     It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
4049     One that you love.
4050     FRIAR LAURENCE
4051     Who is it?
4052     BALTHASAR
4053     Romeo.
4054     FRIAR LAURENCE
4055     How long hath he been there?
4056     BALTHASAR
4057     Full half an hour.
4058     FRIAR LAURENCE
4059     Go with me to the vault.
4060     BALTHASAR
4061     I dare not, sir
4062     My master knows not but I am gone hence;
4063     And fearfully did menace me with death,
4064     If I did stay to look on his intents.
4065     FRIAR LAURENCE
4066     Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
4067     O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
4068     BALTHASAR
4069     As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
4070     I dreamt my master and another fought,
4071     And that my master slew him.
4072     FRIAR LAURENCE
4073     Romeo!
4074     Advances
4075     
4076     Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
4077     The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
4078     What mean these masterless and gory swords
4079     To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
4080     Enters the tomb
4081     
4082     Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
4083     And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
4084     Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
4085     The lady stirs.
4086     JULIET wakes
4087     
4088     JULIET
4089     O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
4090     I do remember well where I should be,
4091     And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
4092     Noise within
4093     
4094     FRIAR LAURENCE
4095     I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
4096     Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
4097     A greater power than we can contradict
4098     Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
4099     Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
4100     And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
4101     Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
4102     Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
4103     Come, go, good Juliet,
4104     Noise again
4105     
4106     I dare no longer stay.
4107     JULIET
4108     Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
4109     Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
4110     
4111     What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
4112     Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
4113     O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
4114     To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
4115     Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
4116     To make die with a restorative.
4117     Kisses him
4118     
4119     Thy lips are warm.
4120     First Watchman
4121     [Within] Lead, boy: which way?
4122     JULIET
4123     Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
4124     Snatching ROMEO's dagger
4125     
4126     This is thy sheath;
4127     Stabs herself

4129     there rust, and let me die.

4134     PAGE
4135     This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
4136     First Watchman
4137     The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
4138     Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
4139     Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
4140     And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
4141     Who here hath lain these two days buried.
4142     Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
4143     Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
4144     We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
4145     But the true ground of all these piteous woes
4146     We cannot without circumstance descry.
4147     Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR
4148     
4149     Second Watchman
4150     Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
4151     First Watchman
4152     Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
4153     Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE
4154     
4155     Third Watchman
4156     Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
4157     We took this mattock and this spade from him,
4158     As he was coming from this churchyard side.
4159     First Watchman
4160     A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
4161     Enter the PRINCE and Attendants
4162     
4163     PRINCE
4164     What misadventure is so early up,
4165     That calls our person from our morning's rest?
4166     Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others
4167     
4168     CAPULET
4169     What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
4170     LADY CAPULET
4171     The people in the street cry Romeo,
4172     Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
4173     With open outcry toward our monument.
4174     PRINCE
4175     What fear is this which startles in our ears?
4176     First Watchman
4177     Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
4178     And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
4179     Warm and new kill'd.
4180     PRINCE
4181     Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
4182     First Watchman
4183     Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
4184     With instruments upon them, fit to open
4185     These dead men's tombs.
4186     CAPULET
4187     O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
4188     This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
4189     Is empty on the back of Montague,--
4190     And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
4191     LADY CAPULET
4192     O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
4193     That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
4194     Enter MONTAGUE and others
4195     
4196     PRINCE
4197     Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
4198     To see thy son and heir more early down.
4199     MONTAGUE
4200     Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
4201     Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
4202     What further woe conspires against mine age?
4203     PRINCE
4204     Look, and thou shalt see.
4205     MONTAGUE
4206     O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
4207     To press before thy father to a grave?
4208     PRINCE
4209     Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
4210     Till we can clear these ambiguities,
4211     And know their spring, their head, their
4212     true descent;
4213     And then will I be general of your woes,
4214     And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
4215     And let mischance be slave to patience.
4216     Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
4217     FRIAR LAURENCE
4218     I am the greatest, able to do least,
4219     Yet most suspected, as the time and place
4220     Doth make against me of this direful murder;
4221     And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
4222     Myself condemned and myself excused.
4223     PRINCE
4224     Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
4225     FRIAR LAURENCE
4226     I will be brief, for my short date of breath
4227     Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
4228     Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
4229     And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
4230     I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
4231     Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
4232     Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
4233     For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
4234     You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
4235     Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
4236     To County Paris: then comes she to me,
4237     And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
4238     To rid her from this second marriage,
4239     Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
4240     Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
4241     A sleeping potion; which so took effect
4242     As I intended, for it wrought on her
4243     The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
4244     That he should hither come as this dire night,
4245     To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
4246     Being the time the potion's force should cease.
4247     But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
4248     Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
4249     Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
4250     At the prefixed hour of her waking,
4251     Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
4252     Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
4253     Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
4254     But when I came, some minute ere the time
4255     Of her awaking, here untimely lay
4256     The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
4257     She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
4258     And bear this work of heaven with patience:
4259     But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
4260     And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
4261     But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
4262     All this I know; and to the marriage
4263     Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
4264     Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
4265     Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
4266     Unto the rigour of severest law.
4267     PRINCE
4268     We still have known thee for a holy man.
4269     Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
4270     BALTHASAR
4271     I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
4272     And then in post he came from Mantua
4273     To this same place, to this same monument.
4274     This letter he early bid me give his father,
4275     And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
4276     I departed not and left him there.
4277     PRINCE
4278     Give me the letter; I will look on it.
4279     Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
4280     Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
4281     PAGE
4282     He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
4283     And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
4284     Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
4285     And by and by my master drew on him;
4286     And then I ran away to call the watch.
4287     PRINCE
4288     This letter doth make good the friar's words,
4289     Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
4290     And here he writes that he did buy a poison
4291     Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
4292     Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
4293     Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
4294     See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
4295     That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
4296     And I for winking at your discords too
4297     Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
4298     CAPULET
4299     O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
4300     This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
4301     Can I demand.
4302     MONTAGUE
4303     But I can give thee more:
4304     For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
4305     That while Verona by that name is known,
4306     There shall no figure at such rate be set
4307     As that of true and faithful Juliet.
4308     CAPULET
4309     As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
4310     Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
4311     PRINCE
4312     A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
4313     The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
4314     Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
4315     Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
4316     For never was a story of more woe
4317     Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
